EventRequest should have fields that keep track of Items (food) that will be at the event.
EventOrders can then be created to keep track of what will be needed. 
The AutomationOrder class should then process through EventOrders to see what is required
and then create Orders based on what we already have vs what needs to be submitted in an Order.
