-- Matt H. Test Data 4/25/19 --

-- [NOTE: 4/27/19 - Matt H.] --
-- Due to the fact that registering a new user on the web site adds a member entry to the
-- Member table in the DB, but there is currently no way that i or other web team members know to log in or access already existing members
-- from the web site, there is a certain order i've had to run db scripts to properly test my feature.

-- I have to run the working db builder, then run new sql additions to add my membertabline stored procedure, then
-- run just the existing test data via the fulltestdata.sql file to get the first six members into the db, and then open VS and register a user via
-- the site. Registering a user on the site then adds a new member to the member table, as well as membertab table, and currently that entry has a membertabid 
-- of 100007, which matches the membertabid foreign key in all of my test data entries. pretty much, what this means is that come presentation day, in order
-- for my mebertabline web feature to be tested and have actual test data, a new user will need to be created on the website, and then my insert statements below will 
-- need to be ran, in that order. will also have to ensure that the memberid and membertabid's being inserted below are 100010, or match whatever is inserted when the 
-- new user is created.
