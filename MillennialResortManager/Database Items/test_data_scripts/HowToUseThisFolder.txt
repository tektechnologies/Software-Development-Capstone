Workflow for using this folder:
0. Make sure 'USE [MillennialResort_DB]
GO' is at the top of your file.
1. Create a file with your name and the date of your submission that has your insert statements in it. 
	(Please use format like YYYY-MM-DD_Name_ContentDescription) This will help keep things in chronological order and 
	will allow you to keep better track of what would be in your file.
2. Modify the addTestData.BAT file to use your .sql file. (Right click, open with notepad++, edit)
	-Just replace the name of the file with the name of your sql file

3. If errors occur, make sure you are following the constraints setup by the DB.
4. If you still cannot figure it out, ask other people for help. 

Benefits of this workflow:
1. You only have to worry about your data. This is for testing your functionality you have chosen. 
	It contains only data relevant to what you need for your part to work. You don't have to worry about invalid data in another part of the DB.
2. You can copy test data from other people's files to quickly populate your section for proper testing.
