Workflow for using this folder:
0. Make sure 'USE [MillennialResort_DB]
GO' is at the top of your file.
1. Create a file with your name and the date of your submission that has your sql in it.
2. Modify the newSqlAdditions.BAT file to use your .sql file. (Right click, open with notepad++, edit)
	-Just replace the name of the file with the name of your sql file
3. If it errors out because it says an object already exists with that name:
	-If it's a table put a 'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS [dbo].[TableName] GO' before the table it errors on
		It does this because it already has a definition for that table and it cannot overwrite it. 
	-If it's a stored procedure use 'DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS [ProcedureName] GO' before the procedure it errors on
		Once again, it does this because it cannot overwrite the definition currently in the master.
		Alternatively, you can replace your CREATE in the procedure with an ALTER (ex. ALTER PROCEDURE sp_select_item)
4. If errors still occur, double check your code.
5. If you still cannot figure it out, ask other people to help. 

Benefits of this workflow:
1. You only have to worry about your SQL and the approved and working SQL.
	 There is no worrying about other people's SQL in the file causing a mess of errors.
2. Cleaner addtion to the master:
	-I (Jared), can just copy your code into the master after testing it and can cleanly delete your file out.
	-No more giant single dev file. Just your work.
